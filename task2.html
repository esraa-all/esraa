            <h2>1. Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A method is a systematic procedure or technique used to achieve a specific outcome. It often involves a series of steps that can be replicated and tested to ensure reliability.</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Methods aim to provide a structured approach to problem-solving or data collection, enhancing accuracy and consistency.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> In scientific research, the <em>experimental method</em> involves formulating a hypothesis, conducting experiments, and analyzing results to draw conclusions.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="comparison">
            <h2>2. Methodology</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Methodology refers to the overarching strategy and rationale of a research project, guiding the choice and application of specific methods. It provides a theoretical foundation for the research approach.</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> A clear methodology helps researchers articulate their processes, ensuring that the methods align with their research questions and objectives.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A researcher may adopt a <em>qualitative methodology</em> that uses interviews and thematic analysis to explore participants' experiences and perspectives.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="comparison">
            <h2>3. Tool</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A tool is a software application or physical instrument that aids in performing a specific task or function, enhancing efficiency and productivity.</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Tools are designed to simplify processes, improve accuracy, and support users in achieving their goals more effectively.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> In software development, <em>Git</em> is a version control tool that allows developers to manage changes in their codebase collaboratively.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="comparison">
            <h2>4. Platform</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A platform is a comprehensive environment that enables the development and execution of applications or services. It can include hardware, software, or a combination of both.</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Platforms provide the necessary infrastructure for users to build, deploy, and manage applications efficiently.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>Microsoft Azure</em> is a cloud platform that offers a wide range of services, including computing, analytics, storage, and networking, allowing businesses to build and scale applications in the cloud.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="comparison">
            <h2>5. Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A framework is a foundational structure that provides guidelines, best practices, and reusable components for developing specific applications. It establishes a standard approach to software development.</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Frameworks help developers maintain consistency, reduce redundancy, and streamline the development process by offering pre-built functions and components.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>Angular</em> is a web application framework developed by Google that simplifies the process of building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) using HTML and TypeScript.</p>
